VSCode Setup
============

VSCode is the recommended and officially supported IDE for FRC Software Development. The installer that WPI provides additionally installs a bunch of handy tools for developing and debugging your robot software.

WPI's distribution of VS Code provides built in tools specific for working with an FRC robot, including buttons to run simulation and deploy the code to your robot. In addition to the WPI extensions, it also comes with tools for integrating with git, and provides decent intellisense for Java and C++.

Installing VSCode
-----------------

Follow the instructions provide by WPI.

Recommendations for options:
- Try to install for "All Users" first. If you are on a locked down computer (such as a chromebook or school laptop), you may need to install for "Just This User"
- "Instal Everything" if you intend to use VS Code as your IDE. If you want to use Intellij as your IDE, you can get away with only doing a "Tools Only" install.


Navigating VSCode
